-> Amazon Dashboard Page Overview -
This project is a basic implementation of an Amazon-style dashboard page built using HTML and CSS. As my first time creating a web page from scratch, this project provided valuable hands-on experience in structuring a webpage layout and styling elements. The dashboard includes key components of a typical e-commerce interface, such as navigation menus, product listings, and user interface elements, giving it a modern and functional look.

-> Features -
Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
Header section with a search bar and navigation links.
Product categories and promotional banners.
Footer section with additional links and information.

-> Technologies Used -
HTML: For structuring the content and elements.
CSS: For styling and layout design.
